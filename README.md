# Amtrak Live

Welcome to [amtraklive.com](https://amtraklive.com/), the website that visualizes the current state of Amtrak's northeast corridor in the style of [E.J. Marey's Paris to Lyon train plot](https://www.researchgate.net/figure/Graphical-train-schedule-E-J-Mareys-1878-graphical-train-schedule-showing-all_fig9_332643897).

Built with R, Python, and React.

This website is a final project for *Political Science 349: Visualization of Political and Social Data* taught by Professor Alexander Coppock at Yale.
