# Amtrak Live

Welcome to [amtraklive.com](https://amtraklive.com/), the website that visualizes the current state of Amtrak's northeast corridor in the style of [E.J. Marey](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/%C3%89tienne-Jules_Marey).

Built with R, Python, and React.

This website is a final project for *Political Science 349: Visualization of Political and Social Data* taught by Professor Alexander Coppock at Yale.
